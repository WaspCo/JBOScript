# Just a Bunch Of Script

## backup_nvme_luks.sh

If you have encrypted your Linux operating system (Fedora in my case), you might find that there is no efficient way to backup and restore your system. You can use 'dd' or any other raw backup tool but you will have to copy the entire disk each time, which is a problem. I made this script to solve this.

For example a dd backup of a 500Go luks disk will use 500Go to store the disk image. This script allows you to only backup the used data inside this disk. For example I managed to backup my 500Go luks disk inside a 50Go encrypted and compressed backup (will vary according to your real disk usage).

Here are the steps for the backup (on a mounted and decrypted system only) :
- Backup the GPT partition table with 'sgdisk' (for safety)
- Backup every decrypted / non-encrypted partitions with 'fsarchiver'

The restoration is a bit trickier :
- Create a new GTP partition table and 3 partitions on the destination disk
  - 1 FAT16 200Mo for EFI (non-encrypted)
  - 2 ext4 1Go for /boot (non-encrypted)
  - 3 LUKS encrypted volume
- Restore partitions 1 & 2 with 'fsarchiver'
- Encrypt and mount partition 3 with 'cryptsetup'
- Create 1 physical volume (pv), 1 volume group (vg) and 2 logical volume (lv) (or 3 if you want to add swap)
- Restore logical volumes 'root' and 'home' with 'fsarchiver'
- Create new UUID for the destination partitions in order to avoid conflicts
- Mount the necessary things in /mnt/luks and chroot it
- Edit /etc/crypttab /etc/fstab and /etc/default/grub and replace the old UUID
- execute 'dracut -f' to regenerate the initramfs images
- execute grub2-mkconfig to update the bootloader
- Exit and reboot. You can now boot a clone of your encrypted system backup

Linux now uses UUID to identify disk (The probability to have same UUID is very low). So if you just duplicate your disk, you will end up with different disks having the same UUIDs (which is not gonna work). That is why you need to create new UUIDs (and therefore it implies to regenerate any files using those identifiers).

!!! BEWARE !!!
- It is assumed that you are running a regular Fedora encrypted with LVM over LUKS.
- It is assumed that you have 3 partitions (efi, boot, luks), and 2 lv inside the LUKS, for now.
- The idiot-proofiness of this script is close to zero, read it before using.
- Should be run as root (It shouldn't break your running system).
- For now root_size=150G, home_size=150G for restoration. An update will soon bring more flexibility.

## backup_workstation.sh

A simple backup script in 3 steps:
- Backup system onto backup disk with 'fsarchiver'
- Backup gpt partition table with 'sgdisk' (for safety)
- Synchronize backup and data disks with 'rsync'


## backup_banana.sh

Another simple backup script. The system is 8Go, only a few things change over time and I stock my backup on a SSD, so here the idea is to use 'dd' to make one full raw backup of partitions 1 & 2 (/ and /boot), mount them and then use rsync each time in the future to update the content of the backups without writing everything again. In case of trouble just 'dd' everything back and voil√†.


## gpu_clocks.sh

Overclock my NVIDIA GPU and start a mining software (claymore). Made for a Zotac GTX1060 6Go. This script is kind of dirty.

The clocks are high but the card never gets into 'Performance Mode', or whatever NVIDIA calls it, when mining. That is an NVIDIA driver bug on Linux with this kind of card. So in fact, the card only gets half of this frequency offsets when mining. OC has to be switched ON/OFF very quickly otherwise the card will get into 'Performance Mode' briefly before / after mining (silly drivers), therefore getting the full frequency offset ... and crash. Do not forget to change the public keys : ]


## fan

A quick access from /usr/local/bin to set the speed of my Thinkpad T470p fan. This computer gets way too hot when pushed.
